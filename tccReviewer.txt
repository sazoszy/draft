1. What are the basic parts of a computer?
  The basic parts of a computer are:
    • Input Devices – Used to enter data (keyboard, mouse, scanner, microphone)
    • Output Devices – Show results (monitor, printer, speakers)
    • System Unit – Main case containing internal hardware
    • Storage Devices – Store data (HDD (Hard Disk Drive), SSD (Solid State Drive), USB (Universal Serial Bus) drive)
    • Communication Devices – Allow network access (LAN (Local Area Network) card, Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity) adapter)

2. What are the basic hardware components inside the system unit?
  • Motherboard – Main circuit board connecting all components
  • CPU (Central Processing Unit) – Brain of the computer; performs calculations
  • RAM (Random Access Memory) – Temporary working memory
  • Storage Drive (HDD/SSD) – Permanent data storage
  • Power Supply Unit (PSU) – Supplies electricity
  • Graphics Card (GPU) – Handles image and video processing
  • Cooling System – Fans or liquid cooling to prevent overheating

3. What is RAM and what is its function?
  - RAM (Random Access Memory) is temporary memory that stores data and programs currently being used by the CPU. 
  - It allows fast access to information, making the system run smoothly. 
  - Data in RAM is lost when the computer is turned off.

4. What is the difference between 32-bit and 64-bit systems?
  - 32-bit systems support up to 4 GB of RAM and are slower with heavy tasks. 
  - 64-bit systems support more than 4 GB of RAM, handle larger data at once, and perform better for multitasking.

5. What is the history of AMD processors?
  - AMD (Advanced Micro Devices) was founded in 1969. 
  - In the 1990s it competed with Intel using Athlon processors. 
  - In 2003, AMD released the first consumer 64-bit CPU (Athlon 64). 
  - In 2017, AMD introduced Ryzen processors, which greatly improved performance and competitiveness.

6. What is the history of Intel processors?
  - Intel released the first commercial microprocessor, the 4004, in 1971. 
  - The Pentium series became popular in the 1990s. 
  - In 2006, Intel launched the Core series (i3, i5, i7), which are widely used today.

7. What is the difference between SSD and HDD?
  - HDDs use spinning disks and are slower but cheaper. 
  - SSDs use flash memory, are much faster, more durable, silent, and more expensive.

8. What is the history of computer storage?
  - Early storage included punch cards and magnetic tape. 
  - Floppy disks were common in the 1980s–1990s. 
  - Hard disk drives provided larger storage capacity. 
  - Solid state drives are modern, faster storage devices with no moving parts. 
  - Cloud storage now allows data to be stored online.

9. How does a graphics card work?
  - A graphics card uses a GPU to process visual data. 
  - The CPU sends visual information to the GPU, which processes geometry, lighting, and textures. 
  - The final image is stored in VRAM and sent to the monitor.

10. What is the history of graphics cards?
  - Early graphics in the 1980s supported only basic 2D images. 
  - In the 1990s, 3D graphics cards improved gaming visuals. 
  - In the 2000s, programmable GPUs allowed advanced effects. 
  - Today, GPUs are used in AI, video editing, and scientific computing.
